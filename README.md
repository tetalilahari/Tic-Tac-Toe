# Tic-Tac-Toe
FRONTEND PROJECT

This is a simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game supports two-player mode where players take turns to mark 'O' and 'X' on a 3x3 grid. It includes features like turn-based logic, automatic win detection, and user interface feedback to declare the winner. The interface is styled to be clean and responsive, and users can start a new game or reset the board at any time using the provided buttons. This project is ideal for beginners to understand basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic in JavaScript. Just open the index.html file in a web browser to play.
