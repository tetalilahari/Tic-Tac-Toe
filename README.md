# Tic-Tac-Toe
FRONTEND PROJECT

This project is a simple yet engaging web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers a classic two-player experience where participants take turns marking 'O' and 'X' on a 3x3 grid. The game is intuitive and easy to use, making it a great choice for casual play and learning purposes.

The core logic of the game is handled using JavaScript, which manages turn switching, win condition checks, and user feedback. As players make their moves, the script evaluates the board to detect a win or a draw, and displays appropriate messages to the users. This real-time interaction helps reinforce concepts like conditional logic, loops, and DOM manipulation.

The interface is styled using CSS to be clean, modern, and responsive. It works smoothly across different devices and screen sizes. Additionally, users are given control options such as starting a new game or resetting the board, which enhances the overall gameplay experience.

This project is especially suitable for beginners who are learning front-end development. It demonstrates fundamental concepts such as HTML structuring, styling with CSS, and interactive behavior using JavaScript.
